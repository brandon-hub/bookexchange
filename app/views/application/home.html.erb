<p> Hey there! Welcome to BookXChange. Near the beginning and end of each semester, 
things can get kind of hectic on Facebook with all the students trying to get rid of 
their used textbooks and materials. Don’t get me wrong, these types of informal 
exchanges are great. Textbook prices these days are absurdly high, and waiting for 
book shipments from online retailers is a little risky. By purchasing from a fellow 
student, you cut out the risk, and you can save big. The problem is that these 
transactions, while effective, can be hard to come by. Sure, you can sit on your class facebook 
page and wait for opportunities, and let’s just say you’re lucky enough to find one 
that matches your needs, well then you better make sure you’re the first student to 
inbox the seller, or your outta luck. BookXchange makes it easy to find and secure 
those opportunities. Here’s how it works...</p>
