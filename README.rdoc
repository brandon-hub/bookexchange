Simple web application meant to aid in used textbook transactions between college students. The app is built on the ruby on rails framework and utilizes jQuery and Bootstrap on the front end. Authentication is handled by the omni-auth authentication system (specifically the facebook component).

The app was never released but most functionality is complete.
